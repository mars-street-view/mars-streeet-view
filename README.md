# Mars Street View

Ever wonder what it's like to explore the wide open red plains of Mars? Do you tire of tedious Earth streets with their painted lines and traffic jams? Mars Street View puts you in the treads of three NASA rovers: Curiosity, Opportunity and Spirit.

Pulling images directly from [NASA's Mars Rover Photos API](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#MarsPhotos), Mars Street View allows you to navigate along the paths of the rovers, while switching between each rover's multiple camera angles.

### Core Features:
* Switch between the three rovers.
* Navigate forward and backward through rover's photo history by date/time
* Switch between camera views for current rover and date/time
* Query photos directly through NASA's API
* Cache 2-5 adjacent photos to increase photo loading speed

### Stretch Goals:
* "play" button to scroll through photos without need for clicking
* Mars map, using Google Mars, showing current lat/lon position of rover where photo was taken
* Show entire rover paths on mars map
* User can click anywhere on path to go to that photo immediately
* User can upvote/favorite photos, so other users can find most popular photos and go straight to them
* Use this or some kind of algorithm to help user find best/most popular photos
